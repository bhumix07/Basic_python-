'''11. Railway Ticket Fare System
A railway system calculates ticket fare based on distance and travel class:
* Distance ≤100 km:
  Sleeper → ₹100, AC → ₹200
* Distance 101–500 km:
  Sleeper → ₹300, AC → ₹600
* Distance >500 km:
  Sleeper → ₹500, AC → ₹1000
Write a Python program to calculate ticket fare.
Input:
Enter distance: 350
Enter class: AC
Output:
Total Fare: ₹600
'''

dist = int(input("Enter distance: "))
clas = input("Enter class (Sleeper/AC):")

if dist<=100:
    if clas =="sleeper":
        print("Total Fare: ₹100")
    else:
         print("Total Fare: ₹200")
elif dist>100 and dist <=500:
    if clas =="sleeper":
        print("Total Fare: ₹300")
    else:
         print("Total Fare: ₹600")
else:
    if clas =="sleeper":
        print("Total Fare: ₹500")
    else:
         print("Total Fare: ₹1000")
