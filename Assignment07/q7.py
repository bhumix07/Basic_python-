"""7. Banking Withdrawal Limit System
A bank wants to set withdrawal limits based on the available account balance:
* Balance less than ₹1000 → Withdrawal not allowed
* ₹1000 to ₹5000 → Maximum withdrawal ₹1000
* Above ₹5000 → Maximum withdrawal ₹5000
Write a Python program to display the withdrawal limit.
Input:
Enter account balance: 3500
Output:
Maximum Withdrawal Limit: ₹1000"""

blnc = int(input("Enter account balance:  "))

if blnc < 1000:
    print("Withdrawal not allowed")
elif(blnc < 5000 and blnc > 1000 ):
    print("Maximum Withdrawal Limit: ₹1000")
else:
    print("Maximum Withdrawal Limit: ₹5000")
