8. Weather Monitoring System

A weather monitoring system classifies the weather condition based on temperature:

* Below 0°C → Freezing
* 0°C to 20°C → Cold
* 21°C to 35°C → Warm
* Above 35°C → Hot

Write a Python program to classify the weather.

Input:
Enter temperature: 38

Output:
Weather Condition: Hot

tem = int(input("Enter temperature: "))

if tem < 0:
    print("Weather Condition:  Freezing")
elif (tem > 0 and tem < 20):
    print("Weather Condition:   Cold")
elif (tem > 21 and tem < 35):
    print("Weather Condition:   warm")
else:
    print("Weather Condition:   hot")
